# Message *for Craft CMS*

Add HTML or Markup notes directly into the CMS alongside a field.

A new fieldtype call "Message" will allow you to create snippets of 'markdown' or 'html' notes. The idea  is to add these where necessary around your CMS via the design filed layout.

Be creative with your instructions and guidlines. Add images, videos or animated gifs to help end-users better understand how to manage a given entry.
